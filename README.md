# it-pro-git-demo
Simple **demo repo** that I am using for "git for IT pros".
 
No seriously - there is not much in here, other then some sample files that I can use to explain the basics of Version Source Control using GIT. I'll probably get terms all screwed up or other things like that - but hey, we're all learning - right?

Feel free to use this repo to understand the basics and know you aren't screwing up a real repo with real content in there you actually care about.
